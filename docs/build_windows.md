## Building the Rlabkey Package on Windows

**Note: ** this requires using the cygwin dlls from the Rtools installation, rather than any preexisting cygwin installation.

- Install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)
 - Tested with Rtools33
 - Default components are correct
  - Do **not** unselect the Cygwin DLLs component
  - TCL/TK is not required
 - Allow installation to edit the system path
  - Click next. There is then an editable preview of the new system path. Leave as is.
  - If reinstalling Rtools, make sure there is only one copy of the new entries in the path

- Install [MiKTeX](http://www.miktex.org/download) for Latex support
 - After installation, open the MiKTeX package manager and install these addtional packages:
  - fancyvrb
  - inconsolata
  - mptopdf
  - url

- Install [qpdf](https://sourceforge.net/projects/qpdf/files/)

- Run 'ant check' and 'ant build'
